This project is an integral part of the Algorithms and Data Structures course. It consistsin the identification of a real world problem, the design of the solution of the problem through computer programming, the development of the minimum viable product of this solution and its presentation. 

Introduction to EasyHome.

Welcome to EasyHome, your go-to app for simplifying the apartment search process and connecting with the perfect roommate. Although designed for international users, it can be used by anyone. EasyHome is dedicated to helping you find not just a place to live, but also someone that complemets to your lifestyle. Explore our user-friendly platform to discover ideal apartments and compatible roommates.

Datasets:
The datasets containing all the appartments information can be found in: 
The information about the students/users registered in our app comes from a Google forms survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSy_nhyyBdQ4avUhnSphkRRb2X5sBGxJgc9Er5y6-B6ADczA/viewform?usp=sf_link. It registers nationality, maximum price, gender, ideal location/zone in Madrid, pets, name and age. Taking all of these into account, the alogorithm will match each person to their most suitable roomate



For those interested in understanding and exploring the algorithms used, the complete version of the code is found in the 'Algorithm' foulder inside this repository.
